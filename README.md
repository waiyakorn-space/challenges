## What I have contributed
- Completed all functional feature.
- Re-organize the codebase.
- Using TailwindCSS for styling.
- Update webpack config.
- Supporting different screen sizes.

## Problems
- I have a problem with TailwindCSS because it can not handle responsive when the screen size is smaller than medium (min-width: 768px) then I can handle just above a large screen (min-width: 1024px) but it doesn't make responsive like I used to do in my previous project, I already fixed it as much as I can. 

Note:Â If you want to see my expectation display please check it in the **"screenshot"** folder.
